Some documentation on the data needed for components:

View for all simulation data:
This is the top parallel coordinates that contains data on all of the simulation runs loaded.  
Each line in the csv should be a different run that contains info on the parameters used, as well as
some info given at the end of the simulation (see below). The lines should be like the following:
PE, GVT interval, batch, num KPs, runtime, % efficiency, net events, roll backs, ...

Radial View for PEs:
A 3D PExPExGVT array for each metric

LP Selector, LP View (grid), and Time Selector:
These components can use the same file.  For each metric, there is a 2D GVTxLP array

Metrics to use:
-# forward events
-# reverse events
