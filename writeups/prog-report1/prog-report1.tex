\section{Data Collection}
So far, we have spent the majority of our time generating and formatting our ever-increasing database consisting of Slim Fly and Dragonfly network simulation performance results. We have decided to make use of multiple hardware systems we have available, including RPI's IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer and a smaller 64-core AMD workstation. Each simulation collects the discrete event simulation performance metrics on a per-process basis throughout the simulated time. The collected metrics include rollbacks, remote events, etc. In addition to the temporal information collected throughout the simulation, we are also collecting total runtime results such as execution time and event efficiency. Right now we are waiting on 720 simulation executions to complete and are expecting the simulations to take over 30 hours to execute and to generate multiple GBs of data. The simulations span varying Slim Fly and Dragonfly model sizes (i.e. small, medium and large networks of routers and compute nodes) as well as varying Global Virtual Time (GVT), batch size, and nKP simulation input parameters in order to arrive at a thorough understanding of the underlying computational structure of the network simulations. 

\section{Unexpected Challenges}
In our ambitious attempt to fully understand the difference between the Dragonfly and Slim fly network simulations, we are performing around 720 executions with different simulation parameters. This large number of runs presents us with another higher-level data selection layer that we hadn't initially taken into account. We currently don't have a visualization that allows the user to interactively select subsets of runs to display their simulation results. Our current implementation would require the user to input each run separately to be analysed on it's own.

\section{Changes}
In response to the unexpected challenge discussed in the previous section, we have decided to generate another parallel coordinates graph at the top of the visualization layout. This parallel coordinates graph will present the high-level results such as runtime and efficiency for all simulation runs and allow the user to select one run or a collection of runs. After selection, the simulation results, network congestion, etc. will be displayed in the original visualizations. In the case that the user selects more than one run, the results will be averaged for all selected runs.
