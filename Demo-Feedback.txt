Questions Asked:
1. Is the interface intuitive?
2. Is it effective?

Answers:
1. Seems intuitive if had a background in the specific simulation approach.
2. Same as 1.

Comments/Questions from Participants:
- Add Radial bundle tension selection to the "Settings" panel
- How will the visualization perform with large amounts of data?
- Will there be a legend with the information?
- Add a description to each plot to describe the available interactions (pop up bubbles) and how to use the figures.
- Make the lines thicker in the top parallel coordinates graph.
- Make font larger on axis labels.
- Is there any desire to perform the visualization in-situ?
- What questions is such a visualization going to answer?
- What will happen if conflicting selections are made?
- Is there a way to unselect?
- Should add a label to radial view to show that some specific GVT has been selected.
- Change saturation of PE links (radial view) based on value of the metric
- (only relevant to EventDrops-like LP view) Make sure that different message types are different colors.
- legend for time selector or have some other way of selecting PEs without making the selection in another graph
- legend for the LP selector so you know which color is router and which is terminal
- legend for radial view to know which are sends/receives
