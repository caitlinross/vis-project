# TODO List

## Data Processing
* Collect data for other metrics (event types).
* Process metric event data into json for radial view.

## Radial View
* Change initial radial path coloring to temperature scale based on given metric value.
* Create functionality to display all connections within a given gvt window for a given selection of PEs.
* Return the PE ID upon mouse click to update data in other views.
* Change hovering to increase intensity/opacity of selected node's connections and decrease intensity/opacity of all other connections.

## LP View
* Decide on EventDrops or Hierarchical Edge Bundeling.

## Time Selector View

## LP Selector View

## Settings Panel
* Add radial bundle tension selection.

## Finishing Touches
* Add a description to each plot to describe the available interactions (pop up bubbles) and how to use the figures.
* Increase font size for axis labels.
* Is there a way to unselect?
* Make the lines thicker in the top parallel coordinates graph.
* Center visualization titles.
* Add a legend of some sort displaying data of some sort?

## Future/If Possible Work
* Is there any desire to perform the visualization in-situ?
* Collect data for Dragonfly.
